# 🐍 Python Logic Building & Mini Projects

Welcome to my Python learning repository! This project documents my journey of mastering Python programming, specifically focusing on **Logic Building**, **Data Structures**, and **Algorithms**.

## 📂 Repository Structure

This repository is divided into two main sections:

### 1. [100 Questions & Solutions](./100_Questions_and_Solution)
A collection of 100+ Python programs covering fundamental concepts:
- ✅ Basic Input/Output & Math Operations
- 🔄 Loops (For, While) & Conditional Statements
- 📦 Data Structures (Lists, Dictionaries, Tuples)
- 📂 File Handling & Error Management
- 🧮 Algorithms (Fibonacci, Factorial, Palindrome, etc.)

### 2. [Small Games Using Python](./Small%20Games%20Using%20Python)
Implementation of logic-based mini-games to strengthen coding foundations:
- **🎲 Number Guessing Game:** Focuses on `loops` and `random` module.
- **✂️ Rock, Paper, Scissors:** Focuses on complex conditions and input validation.
- **🏧 Mini ATM System:** Focuses on state management, math operations, and variable updates.

### 3. Advanced Ludo Game (CLI)
A fully functional Command Line Interface (CLI) Ludo game engine.
- **Features:**
  - 🎮 **Multiplayer Support:** Play with 2 to 4 players.
  - 🤖 **PvC Mode:** Play against the Computer (CPU Logic included).
  - 🐍 **Snakes & Ladders:** Implemented using Python Dictionaries.
  - 🎲 **Game Logic:** Random Dice generation, Exact winning condition, and Turn management.
  - ✅ **Error Handling:** Robust handling for invalid inputs (strings vs integers).

### 4. Tic-Tac-Toe (Zero-Kaata)
A classic 2-player strategy game.
- **Concepts Used:** Arrays (Lists), Indexing, Game Loop, Complex Conditions.
- **Features:**
  - ❌⭕ **Multiplayer:** Alternating turns between 'X' and 'O'.
  - 🏆 **Winning Logic:** Checks all 8 winning combinations (Rows, Columns, Diagonals).
  - 🤝 **Draw Detection:** Smartly identifies when the board is full with no winner.
  - 🛡️ **Input Validation:** Prevents overwriting occupied spots and handles invalid inputs.

### 5. Browser History Simulation (Stack)
A simulation of a web browser's navigation system using Data Structures.
- **Concepts Used:** Stack Data Structure (LIFO - Last In, First Out).
- **Features:**
  - 🌐 **Navigation:** Visit new pages and store them in history.
  - 🔙 **Back Feature:** Navigate to previous pages using `pop()` logic.
  - 🛡️ **Crash Prevention:** Handles empty history errors gracefully.
