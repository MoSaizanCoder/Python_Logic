# 🐍 Python Logic Building & Mini Projects

Welcome to my Python learning repository! This project documents my journey of mastering Python programming, specifically focusing on **Logic Building**, **Data Structures**, and **Algorithms**.

## 📂 Repository Structure

This repository is divided into three main sections based on project type:

### 1. [100 Questions & Solutions](./100_Questions_and_Solution)
A collection of 100+ Python programs covering fundamental concepts:
- ✅ Basic Input/Output & Math Operations
- 🔄 Loops (For, While) & Conditional Statements
- 📦 Data Structures (Lists, Dictionaries, Tuples)
- 📂 File Handling & Error Management
- 🧮 Algorithms (Fibonacci, Factorial, Palindrome, etc.)

### 2. [Logical Programs](./Logical_Program)
Implementation of real-world systems logic using Data Structures:
- **🌐 Browser History Simulation:** - **Concept:** Stack Data Structure (LIFO).
  - **Features:** Simulates 'Back' button functionality using `pop()` and `append()`.
- **🏧 Mini ATM System:** - **Concept:** State Management & Conditions.
  - **Features:** PIN verification, Balance inquiry, and Withdrawal logic.

### 3. [Small Games Using Python](./Small%20Games%20Using%20Python)
Interactive CLI games to strengthen coding foundations:
- **❌⭕ Tic-Tac-Toe (Zero-Kaata):** - **New!** Multiplayer game with Array Logic, Winning Checks, and Draw Detection.
- **🎲 Advanced Ludo Game:** - Full game engine with Snakes & Ladders, CPU mode, and 4-player support.
- **🔢 Number Guessing Game:** - Focuses on `loops`, `random` module, and binary search logic.
- **✂️ Rock, Paper, Scissors:** - Focuses on complex conditionals and input validation.
