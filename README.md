# 🐍 Python Logic Building & Mini Projects

Welcome to my Python learning repository! This project documents my journey of mastering Python programming, specifically focusing on **Logic Building**, **Data Structures**, and **Algorithms**.

## 📂 Repository Structure

This repository is divided into two main sections:

### 1. [100 Questions & Solutions](./100_Questions_and_Solution)
A collection of 100+ Python programs covering fundamental concepts:
- ✅ Basic Input/Output & Math Operations
- 🔄 Loops (For, While) & Conditional Statements
- 📦 Data Structures (Lists, Dictionaries, Tuples)
- 📂 File Handling & Error Management
- 🧮 Algorithms (Fibonacci, Factorial, Palindrome, etc.)

### 2. [Small Games Using Python](./Small%20Games%20Using%20Python)
Implementation of logic-based mini-games to strengthen coding foundations:
- **🎲 Number Guessing Game:** Focuses on `loops` and `random` module.
- **✂️ Rock, Paper, Scissors:** Focuses on complex conditions and input validation.
- **🏧 Mini ATM System:** Focuses on state management, math operations, and variable updates.

### 3. Advanced Ludo Game (CLI)
A fully functional Command Line Interface (CLI) Ludo game engine.
- **Features:**
  - 🎮 **Multiplayer Support:** Play with 2 to 4 players.
  - 🤖 **PvC Mode:** Play against the Computer (CPU Logic included).
  - 🐍 **Snakes & Ladders:** Implemented using Python Dictionaries.
  - 🎲 **Game Logic:** Random Dice generation, Exact winning condition, and Turn management.
  - ✅ **Error Handling:** Robust handling for invalid inputs (strings vs integers).

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Language:** Python 3.x
- **Tools:** VS Code, Git & GitHub
